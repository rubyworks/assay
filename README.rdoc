= Assay

== DESCRIPTION

Assay defines assertions in the same way that Ruby defines
exceptions. An assertion then is nothing more that an
extended Exception class. Assay provides a complete set
of these assertion classes for the most common assertion types.
It also provides both TestUnit-style assertion methods and
RSpec-compatiable matchers built from these assertion classes
for use in your preferred test harness. Assay is compatible with
TestUnit, MiniTest, RSpec and other test frameworks.


== FEATURES

* Mirrors the Ruby Exception system.
* Assertions get their own specialized error messages.
